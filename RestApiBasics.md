# Core REST Concepts

1. REST architectural principles (statelessness, cacheability, uniform interface)
2. Resource design and URI structure
3. HTTP methods and their proper usage (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
4. Status codes and error handling
5. HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State)

# Advanced Design

1. API versioning strategies
2. Authentication mechanisms (OAuth, JWT, API keys)
3. Security best practices (HTTPS, input validation, rate limiting)
4. Pagination and filtering approaches
5. Content negotiation
6. Idempotency and safety

# Performance & Scaling

1. Caching strategies (client-side, CDN, server-side)
2. Rate limiting implementation
3. Batch operations
4. Asynchronous processing patterns
5. Load balancing and distributed systems considerations

# API Management

1. Documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger, API Blueprint)
2. Testing strategies (unit, integration, contract testing)
3. Monitoring and observability
4. Lifecycle management
5. API gateways

# Implementation Experience

1. Practical experience with frameworks (Spring, Express, Flask, .NET Web API.)
2. Database integration patterns
3. Microservices architecture considerations
4. GraphQL vs REST tradeoffs


# Design & Soft Skills

1. API design reviews and governance
2. Backward compatibility considerations
3. Handling API deprecation
4. Cross-team collaboration on API standards
